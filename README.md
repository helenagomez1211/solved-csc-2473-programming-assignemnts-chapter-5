 <li>This assignment asks you to write 2 interactive programs that will give you experience in using the <code>if</code> statement. The input for both programs will come from the keyboard.</li>

 <li>The first program requires the use of nested <code>if</code> statements. Write a program that prompts the user as follows:</li>

</ol>

<blockquote>

 Enter a single letter, and I will tell you what the corresponding digit is on the telephone keypad.

</blockquote>

Suppose the user enters the letter <code>R</code>. Your program will output:

<blockquote>

 The digit 7 corresponds to the letter R on the telephone keypad.

</blockquote>

If the user enters a character that is not a letter on the telephone keypad, for example <code>&amp;</code>, output the following:

<blockquote>

 There is no digit on the telephone keypad that corresponds to &amp;.

</blockquote>

Valid letters on a telephone keyboard include A through P and R through Y. <strong>Z, Q, and all other characters on the computer keyboard should be considered invalid.</strong> The user of the program should be able to enter both <strong>lowercase</strong> and <strong>uppercase letters</strong>. The program output that you turn in should show how your program handles the following characters: <code>C</code>,<code>c</code>,<code>Q</code>,<code>N</code>,<code>n</code>,<code>&amp;</code>. You will have to run your program 6 times.

 <li>The second program requires you to write a program as indicated in Programming Problem #10 on page 240 in your textbook. You are only asked to write a program to find the median of 3 numbers. Please use the following sets of data to test your program:</li>

</ol>

Data set 1: <code>123.67</code> <code>88.22</code> <code>555.11</code>

Data set 2: <code>345.45</code> <code>567.23</code> <code>777.44</code>

Data set 3: <code>879.13</code> <code>445.97</code> <code>675.32</code>
